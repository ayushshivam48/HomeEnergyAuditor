# ‚ö° HomeEnergyAuditor

**HomeEnergyAuditor** is a simple yet impactful Python project that helps users understand and optimize their household energy consumption. It allows individuals to calculate the estimated monthly energy usage, cost, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions for any electrical appliance based on its power rating and usage duration. By analyzing these factors, the program provides personalized suggestions to improve energy efficiency and reduce both electricity bills and environmental impact.

Designed to promote sustainability and energy awareness, this tool is completely self-contained in a single Python file and can be executed easily in any online compiler without requiring additional installations or dependencies. Its simplicity makes it ideal for students, developers, and sustainability enthusiasts who want to explore data-driven energy insights while contributing to a greener future.

As part of **Hacktoberfest**, the **HomeEnergyAuditor** project encourages open-source contributions. Participants can enhance it by integrating data visualization, adding appliance databases, regional electricity pricing, or even smart recommendations for renewable alternatives. This project demonstrates how small-scale tools can contribute to larger sustainability goals, empowering users to make informed and eco-conscious energy choices.
